The notes below are WIP while I revise during a family break in Wales . Edit this Page . Well Architected framework . Whitepaper PDF . General Principles . Stop guessing your capacity needs: Poor capacity decisions can lead to under or over provisioning resources. . Test systems at production scale: Simulate your live environment and then tear it down simce you need only pay for what you use. . Automate to make architectural experimentation easier: Create and replicate workloads with automation. use automation to monitor results and easily and quickly revert if necessary. . Allow for evolutionary architectures: Develop architecture as a continual process as requirements change rather than a static development with ocadsional major version changes. This is because the ability to automate and test reduces impact of changes. . Drive architectures using data: Collect data on architectural changes to make fact-based decisions . Improve through game days: Regularly schedule events where you can simulate production events to better understand workloads and plan around improvements and develop processes for emergencies. .
