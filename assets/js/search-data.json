This is a good video course because at the end of each lesson, the instructor takes you through a couple of sample questions and explaining reasoning behind the correct/incorrect answers. . Questions that I have devised may be applicable. This technique came to me with the Cornell Method of note-taking. . L2: Resillient Architectures &gt; Multi-Tier . Chad’s . An application is currently hosted on an EC2 Instance and consists of static images, Java code and a MySQL database. What steps could be performed to improve the resillience? (pick two.) . Move the database to RDS and enable Multi-AZ. | Resize the EC2 instance to increase memory and CPU. | Move the static images and Javascript to an EFS volume. | Move the static images and JavaScript to an S3 bucket. | Move the static images/Javascript/Java to one EBS volume, and the database to a second volume. | . As an AWS network architect you are responsible for improving the resilience of an existing VPC network with the following configuration: Two AZ with public and private subnets, Internet Gateway and an EC2 NAT instance deployed in one public subnet for private subnet outbound internet traffic. Which of the following recommendations would most improve the resilience of the network architecture? . Deploy public and private subnets into a third AZ. | Upsize the EC2 NAT instance. | Deploy a second EC2 NAT instance in the second AZ. | Replace the EC2 NAT instance with a NAT Gateway. Replacing a SPOF | . | . L3: Resillient Architectures &gt; Design Highly Available and/or Fault-Tolerant Architectures . Chad’s . Assuming your application infrastructure has an availability requirement of 99.99%, which of the following resilience strategies would NOT achieve the required uptime? . Deploying the database back end via RDS with Multi-AZ enabled. | Deploying infrastructure via CloudFormation templates. In a disaster, re-deploy from scratch. | Monitoring on all application layer KPIS with sensitive alarms and early notification, automated mitigation wherever possible. | All web services are hosted behind ALB and use Auto Scaling, both in multiple availability zones. | . As an AWS application architect, you’ve been asked to design a multi-tier application infrastructure that is highly available AND fault tolerant end-to-end. Which of the following solutions would meet these requirements? . Elastic Load Balancer, Auto Scaling on EC2, RDS Multi-AZ. | CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancer, Auto Scaling on EC2, RDS Multi-AZ. | CloudFront, S3, Elastic Load Balancer, ECS on EC2, RDS Aurora Serverless. | S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB. | . L4: Resillient Architectures &gt; Design Decoupling Mechanisms . Chad’s . An application team supports a service that runs on a single EC2 instance with an EIP attached. The service accepts HTTP requests and performs asynchronous work before placing results in a S3 bucket. There is a new requirement to improve the overall resilience of the application. Which of the following decoupling solutions will best improve the resilience of the infrastructure? . Create an AMI of the instance. Launch two instances from the AMI and place them behind an Application Load Balancer. | Create an AMI of the instance. Create an Auto Scaling group using the AMI in a Launch Template, and associate the ASG with an Application Load Balancer. | Create an SQS Queue. Place requests in the queue, and migrate the app code to a Lambda function that is triggered by messages in the queue. | Create an SQS Queue. Place requests in the queue and poll the queue from the EC2 instance | . An application architecture consists of an Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances that communicates with an RDS database for storing relational data. During the daily peak, database writes overload the RDS instance and impact the customer experience. You’ve been asked to evaluate a solution that will protect the user experience during peak load. Which of the following architectural changes will best achieve this? . During peak load, submit database writes to an SQS Queue and process the queue asynchronously after the peak has passed. | Upsize the RDS database instance to increase CPU and memory available during peak. | Provision read replicas to separate RDS read requests from the primary write endpoint. | Migrate the database to DynamoDB and provision the table as On-Demand. | . L5: Resillient Architectures &gt; Appropriate storage . Chad covers availability (S3 Intelligent tiering is 3 9s 99.9%) and durability metrics for instance storage, EBS and EFS as well as if it’s scoped at the Availability zone or Region (S3-Standard) . The durability is measured in ‘Annual Failure Rate’. The AFR of EBS is 0.1% - 0.2%. EG. The durability of EBS snapshots and S3 is 11 9s. . Chad’s . Your team has been asked to implement an AWS storage infrastructure that can support multiple AZs within a region. Multiple EC2 instances will require access to the data. High availability is more important than performance. Which of the following solutions meet the requirements with the least operational overhead? . AWS Storage Gateway in volume cache mode. Data stored in S3. | Individual EBS volumes attached to instances. Data downloaded from S3. | GlusterFS installed on all instances with multiple partitions and replicas of data. | EFS volume deployed in the region. Each EC2 instance mounts the volume via NFS. | . An application is running on a singleton EC2 instance with no opportunity for horizontal scaling. The application data is stored and accessed from a single EBS volume. You’ve been asked to maximize the durability of this data with the ability to recover from accidental deletion of single files. Which of the following steps can be implemented to best meet the requirements? (Choose two.) . Migrate the data to instance storage to improve IOPS performance. | Create a second EBS volume and write all files to both volumes. | Using AWS Backup, schedule a daily snapshot of the data volume. | Create a single AMI of the instance. | Migrate the data to an EBS striped raid filesystem. | . L6: Performant Architectures &gt; Elastic &amp; Scalable compute . Scalability: The ability to increase resources to accomodate increase demand (vertically/horizontally) . Elasticity: The ability to increase and decrease. Automation is implied. . Chad’s . An application is currently deployed using AWS Auto Scaling on EC2. The application experiences a steep traffic spike twice per week, but not always at the same time. The spike usually starts within the same 60 minute window. What strategy could be used to optimize for both cost and a good user experience, as the current Auto Scaling configuration is not able to scale fast enough at the start of the traffic spike? . Configure Scheduled scale-out at the beginning of the hour window on the spike days. | Increase the minimum instance number to more effectively handle the spikes. | Write a shell script to execute manual scaling out before the hour window on spike days. | Configure Predictive Scaling on the Auto Scaling group. | . An application is deployed into an Auto Scaling group for EC2, associated with a Target Group and an Application Load Balancer. The database is a DynamoDB table with on-demand scaling enabled. As traffic increases organically over time, which of the following will need to be reviewed periodically to ensure smooth scaling? (Choose two.) . DynamoDB table maximum read/write ops | Auto Scaling Group maximum instances | DynamoDB table minimum read/write ops | Auto Scaling Group minimum instances | Regional EC2 maximum vCPU quota As traffic increases over time, the number of EC2 instances launched into the Auto Scaling group will increase. These will count against the regional EC2 vCPU quote along with the other EC2 instances. Watching this value and comparing against usage can ensure a smooth scaling experience | . | . https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/aws-certified-solutions/9780136721246/9780136721246-ACS2_00_00_00?autoplay=false &#8617; . |",

I’ve found even instrumental music can be a distraction and make it harder to context switch as well as being damaging to hearing. When working in a physical office with a team of colleagues, it can prevent you from being present. . In recent times though, I’ve found some up-tempo instrumental music can really help maintain a flow state particularly for mechanical tasks. . Here are some toe-tappers. More as they come to me. .

            "content": "A Christmas 2020 present from Mum and Steve on management and leadership. . It does a great job in explaining empathy, archetypes and ‘general craziness of dysfunctional bright people’ with plenty of pertinent and amusing anecodotes. . It’s written for aspiring and current managers and at 3rd edition, Michael writes as though he knows his audience well. He has clearly trodden the boards, delivered software projects, and led teams at Borland and Apple. . My rating: 4/5 . Chapter Notes . CH4 - Rands Test . Where the ‘Joel test’ can be an effective way to get a health check on a software team, the Rands test does the same for general team fitness in the context of management. . A score of 10 or lower - ‘you’ve got serious problems’ . Do you have consistent one-on-ones, about topics other than status? (+1) | Do you have consistent team meetings? (+1) | Are handwritten status reports delivered weekly via email? (-1) | Are you comfortable saying ‘no’ to your boss? (+1) | Can you explain the strategy of your company to a stranger? (+1) | Can you explain current health of the business? (+1) | Is there a regular stand-up by the person in charge? Do you buy it? (+1) | Do you know what you want to do next? (+1) Does your boss? (+1) | Do you have time to be strategic? (+1) | Are you actively killing the grapevine? ie. Do you make a point to kill gossip? (+1) | . CH39 - Incrementalist vs. Realists . Incrementalists and Realists don’t disagree about whether or not we should do something about the problem. We are disagreeing about how much we should do. … There are two distinct personalities when it comes to devising solutions. . Incrementalists are realists and they have a pretty good idea of what is achievable given a problem to solve, a product to ship. … They tend to know all the secrets. . Completionists are dreamers. Their mantra is “If you’re going to spend the time given to solve a problem, solve it in a manner so you aren’t going to be solving it again in 3 months” . Incrementalists need vision and are driven by the goal of progress and constantly moving forward. . Completionists can often see the immediate solution, and the two-year solution and the five-year solution. . CH40 - Organics and Mechanics . The chapter covers how to speak to your manager and to identify if they are one of two personalities and the interpersonal conflict that may arise between the two. Lopp comments that the ensuing ‘organisational warfare’ is a waste of time (and money) as it focuses everyone on the peculiar personality quirks of the other rather than on the business. . Mechanics move forward methodically. They carefully gather information in a structured manner. They quietly observe and are comfortable predictable. They annoy the hell out of the organics . Organics are all over the place. They tend to be loud and can tell a joke. They ask seemingly meaningless questions. . Mechanic: “This guy is walking chaos”Organic: “This guy is totally uptight” . CH52 - Chaotic, Beautiful snowflakes . Engineers have a well-deserved reputation for regularly being off by a factor of three in their work estimates, partly due to the fact that we are really shitty at estimating the no-linear chaotic work that exists in keeping a group of humans pointed in the right direction. . Michael’s parting thought . The hard work of great leadership isn’t just managing the expected tasks that we can predict - it’s the art of successfully traversing the unexpected. .",
