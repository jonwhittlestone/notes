# The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read (and your chldren will be glad you did) by Phillpa Perry

I read this April 2021 and thorughly enjoyed it.

I decided to pick it up because I aim to have more tuned in emotional intelligence/empathy. I'd like to be deal with anger better and learn to regulate my emotions.

Reflecting, after finishing the book, it may seem to contain a lot of touchy feely wisdom but it's rooted in empirical pyschological study and research as well as containing case studies of Phillipa's patients.

Phillipa Perry is a psychotherarpist for 20+ years. Her and her husband (Grayson, the artist) have a daughter.

I found useful strategy after useful strategy for how to create and maintain a happy and harmonious household, but I found it hard to believe that her own life bringing up a toddler was completely conflict free and hippy dippy lovely as her advice conveys!

With that said, here are a few of my key takeaways.

* Constructive conflict.
  * Using 'I-statements' rather than 'You-statements' are less accusatory
    * > “A good rule of thumb when arguing is to do it with ‘I- statements’, not ‘you-statements’, for example ‘I feel hurt when you don’t answer me when you’re on your phone’, not ‘You’re always ignoring me when you’re on your phone.’ Few of use like to be defined or pigeon-holed – especially negatively – by someone else. If you instead describe how what you hear or see makes you feel, then you are talking about yourself, which is far easier for the other person to hear."
  * 'Fact tennis'
