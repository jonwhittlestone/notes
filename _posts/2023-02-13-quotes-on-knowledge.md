# The paradox of Knowledge

In the last few years I've managed to wean myself of my Hacker News addiction but only subscribing to the weekly digest email, [HackerNewsLetter](https://hackernewsletter.com/?ref=find-your-newsletter)

It's an excellent resource, thank-you team!

Anyway, there was [a thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34710830) asking the community the following:

The subsequent comments had a few useful quotes so I thought I'd capture them for posterity.

```
Knowledge isn't free. You have to pay attention

― Richard Feynman
```

```
The purpose of knowledge is action, not knowledge.

― Aristotle
```

```
The wise man knows the Self,
And he plays the game of life.
But the fool lives in the world
Like a beast of burden.

― Ashtavakra Gita (4―1)
```

```
A preoccupation with the means is a lack of commitment to the end
```

Many more interesting tidbits, on [the thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34710830).
