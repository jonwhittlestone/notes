I had my exam booked for 19/03 and then Covid hit. I actually turned up to the venue in Crawley only to be greeted by a hastily written note taped on the door telling me all exams are cancelled.

Having not had an email, and having studied fairly hard for many months we can say I wasn't overjoyed.

It's all good now, I've rescheduled for the remote exam and have restarted my revision.

Here is the course outline for Chad Smith's live lessons course from O'Reilly [^1].
