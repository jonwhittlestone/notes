Not in keeping with the traditional developer image, I've shyed away from listening to music through headphones whilst writing code.

I've found even instrumental music can be a distraction and make it harder to context switch as well as being damaging to hearing. When working in a physical office with a team of colleagues, it can prevent you from being present.

In recent times though, I've found some up-tempo instrumental music can really help maintain a [flow state](https://www.headspace.com/articles/flow-state) particularly for mechanical tasks.

Here are some toe-tappers. More as they come to me.
