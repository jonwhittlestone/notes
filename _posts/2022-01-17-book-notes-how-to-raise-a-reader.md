My sister and I had previously spoken about the fact I was reading this book.

When she'd seen on Goodreads that I'd finished it and given it 3/5 she said this:

Here's my response, my hastily written notes.

Long answer! thanks, give me a chance to sum up.

tldr


I think I might need to revisit this book for Part Two - 'growing a reader'
when they're olderz

The beginning had a bunch of good tips and tactics for young kids
at the start which I'll take away. Things like...

babies
- read to your baby, instilling familiarity with the mechanics of reading
- wordless books are fantastic opportunity to build visual literacy
- board books!
- simple art and design

young kids
- book discussion at the dinner table and in normal family life, not just bedtime
- books on show in the living areas etc (most correlated statistic for literacy than parents income level, standard of education)
- evidence of parental reading/appreciation
- If you're on a Kindle, mention words or discuss your book so they realise you're reading
- celebrate the library and book shop
- boys might favour non-fiction, comics more than stories
- books as birthday gifts
- ask party guests to wrap one of their own books and bring it to party then give out to kids instead of a party bag containing sweets and plastic
- Gifting a book to a child, inscribe the jacket with a line on what's he like at this age
- books starring tv character can make kids crave even more TV time

older kids, and young adults

...

Its recommendations of actual books were all US-centric - arguably not the fault of the author when the reader is from UK.

Towards the end, the format of the book made for a grueling read - for each age group, just a list of unconnected recommendations.
