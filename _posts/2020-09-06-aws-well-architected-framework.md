In Chad Smith's seminar he suggested being very familar with the Well Architected framework white papers is essential foundation for my upcoming associate architect exam.

The notes below are WIP while I revise during a family break in Wales

## Well Architected framework

[Whitepaper PDF](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf)

### General Principles

> Stop guessing your capacity needs: Poor capacity decisions can lead to under or over provisioning resources. 

> Test systems at production scale: Simulate your live environment and then tear it down simce you need only pay for what you use.

> Automate to make architectural experimentation easier: Create and replicate workloads with automation. use automation to monitor results and easily and quickly revert if necessary.

> Allow for evolutionary architectures: Develop architecture as a continual process as requirements change rather than a static development with ocadsional major version changes. This is because the ability to automate and test reduces impact of changes.

> Drive architectures using data: Collect data on architectural changes to make fact-based decisions

> Improve through game days: Regularly schedule events where you can simulate production events to better understand workloads and plan around improvements and develop processes for emergencies.
