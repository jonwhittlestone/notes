The amount of time I spend looking at a mobile phone screen is diverting my attention from what's important. 

I've taken a major step and started using a phone without a web browser and apps. 

Some say, a _rash_ step.

Some say, an _isolating_ step.

I say, it's an attempt to try and be in the moment a bit more. Especially as lockdown restrictions are ending and everyone will finally be allowed outside. All that refound excitement in the world, why do I need to check social feeds on a smartphone??

This week I started using [Light Phone II](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/light-phone-one-week) as an experiment. It's an E Ink phone with limited features. 
However, in case you need to use the internet connection with another device, it does have a 4G modem with the ability to tether the connection (It's an Android OS under the covers)

Prehaps I will feel fairly isolated at first but may mean I'm a better parent, husband and focused [consultant](http://howapped.com)!

### No WhatsApp?

Yep, that's right, no apps. But I can message with SMS, and I can get [Signal](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/13684416/what-is-signal-whatsapp-users-change-app/) on my computer.

### Er, calendar?

I have an integration with Google Calendar and Zapier set up which'll SMS me calendar entries.

### Maps ??

Yes, apparently there's a service that will text you directions
