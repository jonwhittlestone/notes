The amount of time most I spend looking at mobile phones is diverting my attention from what's important. 

I've taken a drastic step and started using a phone without a web browser and apps. It's an attempt to try and be in the moment a little more. Especially as lockdown restrictions are ending and everyone will finally be allowed outside. All that refound excitement in the world, why do I need to check social feeds on a smartphone??

This week I started using [Light Phone II](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/light-phone-one-week) as an experiment. It's an E Ink phone with limited features. 
However, in case you need to use the internet connection with another device, it does have a 4G modem with the ability to tether the connection (It's an Android OS under the bonnet)

I imagine I'll feel fairly isolated at first but may mean I'm a better parent, husband and worker drone!

### No WhatsApp?

Yep, that's right, no apps. But I can message with SMS, and I can get [Signal](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/13684416/what-is-signal-whatsapp-users-change-app/) on my computer.

### Maps ??

Yes, apparently there's a service that will text you directions
