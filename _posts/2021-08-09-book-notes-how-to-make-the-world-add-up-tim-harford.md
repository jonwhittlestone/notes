My notes

---

Tim Harford is a very engaging writer who appears part statistician, part economist, part historian.

The ultimate message from this `very entertaining author is _be curious_

> Rule One: Notice your emotional response<br><br>_Don't accept or reject a claim just because of how it makes us feel_

> Rule Two: Combine Statistical perspective with the 'worm's eye' personal view

> Rule Three: Do we actually understand the labels?

> Rule Four: Put claims into perspective by looking for comparisons and context.

> Rule Five: Look behind the stats and where they came from.

> Rule Six: What's missing or not being represented.<br><br>_Would our conclusions differ if they were included?_

> Rule Seven: Ask tough questions about algorithms?<br><br>_Without intelligent openness, the big datasets that drive the algos cannot be trusted_

> Rule Eight: Pay attention to the bedrock of official statistics.

> Rule Nine: Look under the surface of any beautiful graph or chart.

> Rule Ten: Keep an open mind.<br><br>_Be like John Maynard Keynes who can change his mind and adapt with the times, not like Irving Fisher_
