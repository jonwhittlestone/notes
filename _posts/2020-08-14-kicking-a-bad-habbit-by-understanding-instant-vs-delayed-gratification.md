I'm partial to a brain hack.

Not a physically violent, murderous one, but the type of fix for something where you can be fooled into doing something when your unconscious mind is trying to stop or distract you because it thinks it can do better.

As is the case with many of the articles on this blog, this post exists for my own benefit.
It's something to revisit and digest to keep focused lest getting distracted by timewasting endeavours.


## Understanding Gratification

Recently, my Dad sent over this article which explains instant versus delayed gratification.

In summary, if you hold off doing something for the quick dopamine hit, holding off could be better in the long run.

As someone with a bit of an issue with fat and sugar-laden foods, this is something to keep in mind.

## Digital Detox

I came across this one a few months ago. This does a good job of explaining chemical drivers of instant gratification and presents the benefits of letting your dopamine receptors recover from constant gratification.

Watch it. Detoxing sounds dull right? 

That's the point.

> You become so bored, that boring stuff becomes more fun

But as the previous video explains, you'll see benefits further down the line.
