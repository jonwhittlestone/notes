<p>I had my exam booked for 19/03 and then Covid hit. I actually turned up to the venue in Crawley only to be greeted by a hastily written note taped on the door telling me all exams are cancelled.</p>

<p>Having not had an email, and having studied fairly hard for many months we can say I wasn’t overjoyed.</p>

<p>It’s all good now, I’ve rescheduled for the remote exam and have restarted my revision.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<p>This is a good video course because at the end of each lesson, the instructor takes you through a couple of sample questions and explaining reasoning behind the correct/incorrect answers.</p>

<p>Questions that I have devised may be applicable. This technique came to me with the <a href="http://lsc.cornell.edu/notes.html?utm_source=hackernewsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=learn">Cornell Method</a> of note-taking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An application is currently hosted on an EC2 Instance and consists of static images, Java code and a MySQL database. What steps could be performed to improve the resillience? (pick two.)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Move the database to RDS and enable Multi-AZ.</strong></li>
  <li>Resize the EC2 instance to increase memory and CPU.</li>
  <li>Move the static images and Javascript to an EFS volume.</li>
  <li><strong>Move the static images and JavaScript to an S3 bucket.</strong></li>
  <li>Move the static images/Javascript/Java to one EBS volume, and the database to a second volume.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an AWS network architect you are responsible for improving the resilience of an existing VPC network with the following configuration: Two AZ with public and private subnets, Internet Gateway and an EC2 NAT instance deployed in one public subnet for private subnet outbound internet traffic. Which of the following recommendations would most improve the resilience of the network architecture?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Deploy public and private subnets into a third AZ.</li>
  <li>Upsize the EC2 NAT instance.</li>
  <li>Deploy a second EC2 NAT instance in the second AZ.</li>
  <li><strong>Replace the EC2 NAT instance with a NAT Gateway.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Replacing a SPOF</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming your application infrastructure has an availability requirement of 99.99%, which of the following resilience strategies would NOT achieve the required uptime?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Deploying the database back end via RDS with Multi-AZ enabled.</li>
  <li><strong>Deploying infrastructure via CloudFormation templates. In a disaster, re-deploy from scratch.</strong></li>
  <li>Monitoring on all application layer KPIS with sensitive alarms and early notification, automated mitigation wherever possible.</li>
  <li>All web services are hosted behind ALB and use Auto Scaling, both in multiple availability zones.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an AWS application architect, you’ve been asked to design a multi-tier application infrastructure that is highly available AND fault tolerant end-to-end. Which of the following solutions would meet these requirements?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Elastic Load Balancer, Auto Scaling on EC2, RDS Multi-AZ.</li>
  <li>CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancer, Auto Scaling on EC2, RDS Multi-AZ.</li>
  <li>CloudFront, S3, Elastic Load Balancer, ECS on EC2, RDS Aurora Serverless.</li>
  <li><strong>S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB</strong>.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>An application team supports a service that runs on a single EC2 instance with an EIP attached. The service accepts HTTP requests and performs asynchronous work before placing results in a S3 bucket. There is a new requirement to improve the overall resilience of the application. Which of the following decoupling solutions will best improve the resilience of the infrastructure?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Create an AMI of the instance. Launch two instances from the AMI and place them behind an Application Load Balancer.</li>
  <li>Create an AMI of the instance. Create an Auto Scaling group using the AMI in a Launch Template, and associate the ASG with an Application Load Balancer.</li>
  <li><strong>Create an SQS Queue. Place requests in the queue, and migrate the app code to a Lambda function that is triggered by messages in the queue.</strong></li>
  <li>Create an SQS Queue. Place requests in the queue and poll the queue from the EC2 instance</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tag all S3 buckets and objects to indicate the presence of PHI. Create IAM Policies and S3 bucket policies using conditions based on the tags.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Tagging alone isn’t a security control but may be used as a building block towards least privilege</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create an S3 full-access IAM policy and associate with users requiring PHI access. Create a more restrictive IAM policy for the non-PHI users.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Any strategy tbat involves “full” access to any any service will struggle to meet a least privilege requirement</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tag all IAM users based on PHI access. Test for those tags using IAM Policy and S3 bucket policy conditions for object access and KMS CMK usage.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Along with tagging, provides a mechanism for testing users with access rights</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Write an application to interface with S3 and implement access using custom code. Create IAM policies and S3 bucket policies to allow access only through the application
    <ul>

  <p>An application has a requirement for end-to-end, in-transit encryption for all web traffic. The architecture will require a load balancer, and the Elastic Load Balancer service is being considered. Which of the load balancer options would meet the application encryption requirement? (Choose two.)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Classic Load Balancer, SSL listener</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>The SSL listener does not terminate the connection (because operates on layer 4) and will preserve the encryption from the client to the backend resource</em></li>

  <li>Classic Load Balancer, TCP listener
    <ul>
      <li><em>Does not terminate connection but not encrypted so does not meet requirement</em></li>

  </li>
  <li>Classic Load Balancer, HTTPS listener
    <ul>
      <li><em>HTTPS listener operates at layer 7 (Application layer) and will terminate the connection before reencrypting so does not meet requirement</em></li>

  </li>
  <li>Application Load Balancer
    <ul>
      <li><em>Can only create HTTPS listener and will terminate and reincrypt</em></li>

  <li><strong>Network Load Balancer</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Only implements layer 4 listeners so will be sufficient if SSL listener is used</em></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>After an audit of your company’s AWS bill, there is an initiative to reduce costs, and you’ve been asked to focus on S3 usage. There are tens of millions of large objects spread across many buckets. The usage patterns are varied by bucket and prefix, and are not always predictable. Which of the following cost optimization strategies would be the most appropriate?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Provision CloudFront distributions using the S3 buckets as origins to reduce the cost of
accessing the objects by caching.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Cloudfront won’t impact actual S3 storage costs</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Manually migrate all objects to S3 Infrequent Access to reduce storage costs.
    <ul>
      <li><em>May make a difference but if we don’t know access costs, may baloon costs</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create lifecycle policies on the S3 buckets that migrate objects to cheaper storage classes as they age, regardless of usage patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Migrate objects to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class to automate the optimization of
storage costs based on access frequency
    <ul>
      <li><em>Solution that will allow you to account for variability</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>An application has a storage requirement of several terabytes on a single volume. The application owner would like to optimize for cost, and performance is not a priority. The application owner cannot predict the number of IOPS that will be required, but is ok with the drive being throttled as long as cost is top priority. Which EBS volume type would best meet the requirements?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Standard</li>
  <li><strong>SC1</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>will only charge you based on volume size</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ST1</li>
  <li>GP2</li>
  <li>PIOPS</li>
