<h1 id="my-notes-on-10-days-to-a-less-defiant-child">My notes on “10 Days to a Less Defiant Child”</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>If children live with hostility they learn to fight. If children live with kindness and consideration, they learn respect. Excerpt from “Child Learn What They Live” by Dorothy Law Nolte.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this book to offer pragmatic and practical approaches to understanding and dealing with defiant children. Dr. Jeffrey Bernstein is a licensed psychologist who specalised in child and family therapy. Much of the ideas in this book are backed by research and his case history.</p>

<p>Lisa and I read this at roughly the same time. This proved a useful strategy because we could discuss the content in relation to our day-to-day parenting.</p>

<p>I’ve found the skills and strategies can <strong>easily be forgotten</strong> in the cut and thrust of daily parenting of a defiant 5 year old so it helps me to rewrite my notes and to revisit (often if I can)</p>

<p><strong>My main summaries</strong> are; defiant kids are emotionally underdeveloped and need much more love, patience and unconditional acceptance from their caregivers. Have persistence and the <strong>bravado of defiance can be penetrated by being calm, firm and noncontrolling</strong>. It stands to reason that <strong>the more you try to control your defiant child, the more she will try to control you.</strong></p>

<p>Jeffrey makes a valid point that parents are just as unlikely to be succesful in managing defiant kid by being overly persistent because they lose credibility and repect.</p>

<p>Success will come by keeping your cool and encouraging your child to talk to you in the same way. More positive attention and privileges come if he walks the calm, firm and noncontrolling road with you.</p>

<p>I particularly liked the anger management passages as its something I’ve been trying to work on this year. For example rather than a “fire at will” approach it’s more a “ready, aim, fire” strategy.</p>

<p>Here are my notes (highlights from my eReader)</p>

<h2 id="day-1---grasping-why-your-child-acts-defiant">DAY 1 - Grasping Why Your Child Acts Defiant</h2>

<h3 id="standout-themes">Standout themes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>“You are not alone - and stop comparing yourself to other parents”</li>
  <li>The child <strong>needs your help</strong> to overcome his defiance. He needs to unlearn his entitlement-laden, impulse-driven way of handling his emotions. <strong>The best gift you can ever give him is to be persistent</strong></li>
  <li>If you are able to model being accountable for their negative parenting behaviours, the more you can influence the child to do the same.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-1-notes">DAY 1 Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can say for sure <strong>what causes defiant behaviour</strong> in children. It may be inherited through genes, it may be caused by problems in brain chemistry
<br /><br />…<br /><br />
How a family reacts to a child’s behaviour plys a big role in the development of defiant behaviours.
<br /><br />…<br /><br />
The truth is that many children, expecially when they are tired, hungry, or upset, tend to disobey, argue or defy authority.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Underlying influences driving oppositional behaviour <strong>may be feelings of inadequacy due to concerns such as … sibling conflicts</strong></p>

<h4 id="dwelling-on-past-conflicts">Dwelling on past conflicts</h4>

  <p>Once a problem is conflict is resolved, try not to mention it again. Children should be allowed to start again. Parents bringing up past mistakes are teaching them to hold grudges.</p>

<h3 id="standout-themes-1">Standout themes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unselfishly listening is key, with the goal of <strong>understanding</strong> with the <strong>delay and containment</strong> of your own judgement. This means, ‘listen with a closed mouth’ / no interruptions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research on defiant children shows they lack emotional intelligence and maturity. It appears that the things your child <em>chooses</em> not to to (control impulses) and things he <em>is unable</em> to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A defiant child may leave him feeling misunderstood like an outside in the family. He is desperately trying to gain a sense of belonging and approval. <strong>Look underneath the bravado of his defiance.</strong></p>

Overgeneratlising
Traps leading to misunderstanding defiant children</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Overgeneralising<br /><br />If your child cannot meet your expectations you assume he is being defiant instead of looking closely from your child’s point of view. A mother to 6 y.o Todd, Denise, activaly looked for instances of Todd being cooperative and he actually became more coopoerative. Perception is reality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Expecting your child to meet your needs<br /><br />The more you understand your child’s challenges, the less uptight you will be about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Love heals: Many moving breakthroughs have begun with their parents hugging them in my office</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think of positive exceptions and build on them to counter negative thoughts.<br /><br />The more you recognise your chil’s positive and appropriate behavious the better able you can adopt a more positive mindset. Disrupting negative thought patterns takes work and pateience.</p>

<p>It shows your kids that you’ve lost control. Leading to problems later: Research shows it gives way to kids who are more likely to display phyiscal/verbal agression or social withdrawal leading to a lack of positive/prosial behaviours such as sharing/empathy.</p>

<h3 id="standout-themes-2">Standout themes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To prevent them tuning out, avoid shouting. Otherwise defiance only increases.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention-seeking: Teaches kids to even get the wrong kind of attention, kids misbehave.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Your goal is to join with your child, not be her adversary. Work with - rather than against - your child to lower her defiance.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focused whispering can be a good alterivate to yelling as whispering often holds a child’s attention much powerfully than yelling</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The times when I’m most prone to a shouting trigger is the nearer we get to leaving for the house for school. During a quiet time, <strong>we need to map out a “morning routine”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be an active listener and try to problem-solve and ask what the child would look to change it. Understanding what is going on will help slow you down emotionally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communicate whose problem it is. You may have a headache and defiant children don’t always undertand how what they do affects their parents.</p>
  </li>

<h3 id="day-4-notes">DAY 4 Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A power struggle is really about your defiant child (and quite possibly, you) trying to compensate for her feelings of inadequacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When defiant children act out, they are most often feeling powerless and discouraged about their own self-worth. The key to stopping this from happening is to <strong>learn how to sidestep power struggles.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Defiant children can often seem to be in a good mood, and then <strong>all of a sudden the power struggle switch is flipped.</strong> Like volcanoes erupting these power struggles are often laden with hotly charged, overflowing negative emotions.<br /><br />…<br /><br /><strong>Unfortunately, they will likely still occur even if you don’t yell.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While he may not verbalise it, <strong>your defiant child strongly wants to feel your love and approval</strong>. At the same time he yearns for the freedoms and choices of an adult. Most defiant kids I’ve worked with are <strong>confused - intellectually</strong> they <strong>knw that they are loved,</strong> but they <strong>don’t feel loved.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As <strong>you learn not to get sucked in</strong> to power struggles, your child will feel more unconditional love from you. The challenge for you as a parent is to maintain your integrity and parental values while not getting caught up in the power stuggles.<br /><br />…<br /><br /><strong>most good parenting strategies fail because parents give up too quickly</strong> So please be patient and determined.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are in the company of many other parents who have felt <strong>disempowered and threatened</strong> during power struggles.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Calm and firm may intially feel unnatrual and awkward</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make a mentall and written list of the times you resisted power struggles</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remind yourself that the more power you give away, the less power you leave for your defiant child to try to take away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On picking your battles</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ask yourself - <strong>“Will this really matter to her when she’s thirty</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Verbalise your conerns in a <strong>calm</strong>, <strong>firm</strong> and <strong>noncontrolling</strong> manner. Don’t get hung up on trying to get immediate compliance or a positive response. <strong>Plant the seed then let it germinate</strong><br /><br />…<br /><br /><strong>“Now when I don’t appreciate her tone or her behaviour I just calmly and firmly state how I feel and slowly walk away.</strong></p>

<p>On rewards</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more you encourage positive behaviour in your child, the more definant behaviour is discouraged.<br />…<br /><strong>“That which gets noticed gets repeated</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your child’s behaviour is prominent on your radar screen because it’s something you find upsetting and frustrating. So you’ve paid close attention to it. Believe me, this tendency to zoom in on the bad is very common, and not just in parenting.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <strong>rewards to encourage appropriate behaviour rather than to stop an inappropriate one</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Verbal praise is the best kind of reward because it’s doesn’t come from a store. <br /><br />…<br /><br />**“I really admire the time and hard work you put into that”” People of all agest crave the approval of their parents. **You are a powerful person to your child. You always have been and you always will be. Praise from you has weight. It means something**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To avoid perception on insincerity, <strong>Make your comment then stop talking about it</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Important to show why what he did was different before and why it was helpful<br /><br />“Thanks for clearing your books off the table without my asking you. It really helped me focus on getting kitchen cleaned up while you did that”</p>

<h2 id="day-6---dependable-discipline">DAY 6 - Dependable Discipline</h2>

<p>The chapter focuses on how to use consequences with a defiant child effectively.</p>

<h3 id="standout-themes-5">Standout themes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Discipline is teaching.<br /><br /><strong>“I feel disappointed that you hit her. I know that you can continue to learn to make better choices when you’re frustrated and angry”</strong><br /><br /><strong>“I cannot accept you talking to me in that manner</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many parents model discipline on how they were disciplined by their parents or what they think is “the right thing to do” - but this often involves punishment or applying a penalty in a harsh way. <strong>The punshment mentalitilty does not teach or support your child to make important positive changes. <br /><br />Instead a punishment mind-set uses shame, control and inimidation to influence your child to behave differently</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>central part of the defiant child package is a lack of remorse. Don’t take it so personally. They lack maturity and coping skills. Their brain is physically different.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequences seem to have little effect because defiant child thinks of parents as their equeal. Defiant child react to (threats of) consequences by feeling pressured because he feels controlled. His thinking then becomes even more distorted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you do need to give consequences (eg. because a known rule has been broken) be <strong>calm, firm, non-controlling</strong> as well as selectively and non-agressively.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-6-notes">DAY 6 notes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Defiant children are much less likely to misbehave</strong> when they <strong>feel understood and not controlled.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Parents of defiant kids can get very upset because they don’t believe their chldren are remorseful for their misbehaviour</strong> The problem will only escalate if you become distraught about this lack of remorse on the part of your child. Because they lack emotional maturing and coping skills, this leads them to test you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most parents hear the word “discipline” they think of “consequences”<br />…<br /><strong>Consequences alone won’t teach your child the values and skills that are important for self-worth, problem solving and self-control.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since <strong>defiant children tend to see themselves as your equal, they rebel against punishment</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If your child did not break a known rule, then consequences are not needed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Immediate responses that occur soon after misbehaviour are much more effective. Delayed consequences give the defiant child time to rev up.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“It’s your behaviour I dislike, not you!”</strong></p>

<h2 id="day-7---rallying-family-support">DAY 7 - Rallying Family Support</h2>

<h3 id="standout-themes-6">Standout themes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the family dynamic, unfavourable comparisons or the label of ‘problem child’ can cause the defiant child to be “emotionally wounded” or treat the defiant child as the family scapegoat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the siblings, you don’t want them picking up on your verbal/non-verbal cues because otherwise you’ll have some major repair work to do. Non-verbal examples are eye rolls, sighs, gasps</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comparison also stands true between your defiant child and other children eg children of friends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good way to encourage family cooperation is introducing rituals. They create a climate of support and emotional healing. They create a structure for share time and develop a sense of shared joys.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one-on-one time; a defiant child told Jeffrey that **as much as she likes the clothes and other material things she gest from her parents hall we have a quick catch up now?what she really enjoys is positive attention. “The one thing that means most is the time they spend with me”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>On anger management; <strong>rather than a ‘fire at will’ approach, it’s now ‘ready, aim, fire’</strong> It is something to be rewarded and important that <strong>your children see you deal successfully with your anger</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid toxic thoughts and words (eg. hate, should, must, never, always)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not neglect marriage because having a defiant child can make it harder to stay connected as a couple because of the emotional demands this creates.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do: Give each other (coparents) credit when you handle defiant child in a good way. “Catch” each other being calm, firrm and non-controlling.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t: make “you” statements</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t: be sarcastic or unkind with your criticism</p>

  <p>Do: ask for clarification if needed. It’s likely to diffuse the situation.</p>

  <p>Contact the teacher as soon as you suspect your child has a problem with his behaviour or staying afloat academically. A 3 way conversation can set the record straight.</p>

  <li>This may also be dispplayed as being passive agressive by subtly inciting or provoking others. Defiant kids will lash out at teachers and peers whom they feel threatened and disconnected from. <strong>Many teachers have not undergone the appropriate training for handling defiance in the classroom</strong></li>
</ul>

  <p>Be proactive and learn everythin you can about your child’s school and current class situtation. The more you know, the easier your job will be. Being vigilant and proactive will ensure you won’t be taken by surprise when reports are released.</p>

  <p>Try coaching your child to talk to his teacher if he doesn’t understand an assignment.</p>

  <li>Defiant kids have a low tolderance for frustration and once ADHD is thrown into the mix the added chaos can exacerbate defiant tendencies. Parents forget that children ADHD often <em>cannot</em> control themselves to stay focused, control their impulses or be quiet. ADHD is a nerological problem.</li>

<p>Teachers must ensure that the following are done to support the child</p>

<ul>
  <li>Break large tasks into small tasks so children don’t get overwhelmed</li>
  <li>Give positive feedback</li>
  <li>Provide additional time for homework, classwork, tests and projects to compensate for attention problems.</li>

<p><img src="/notes/images/posts/j5aX4cY.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s my response, my hastily written notes.</p>

<hr />

<p>Long answer! thanks, give me a chance to sum up.</p>

<p>tldr</p>

<p>I think I might need to revisit this book for Part Two - ‘growing a reader’
when they’re olderz</p>

<p>The beginning had a bunch of good tips and tactics for young kids
at the start which I’ll take away. Things like…</p>

<p>babies</p>
<ul>
  <li>read to your baby, instilling familiarity with the mechanics of reading</li>
  <li>wordless books are fantastic opportunity to build visual literacy</li>
  <li>board books!</li>
  <li>simple art and design</li>
</ul>

<p>young kids</p>
<ul>
  <li>book discussion at the dinner table and in normal family life, not just bedtime</li>
  <li>books on show in the living areas etc (most correlated statistic for literacy than parents income level, standard of education)</li>
  <li>evidence of parental reading/appreciation</li>
  <li>If you’re on a Kindle, mention words or discuss your book so they realise you’re reading</li>
  <li>celebrate the library and book shop</li>
  <li>boys might favour non-fiction, comics more than stories</li>
  <li>books as birthday gifts</li>
  <li>ask party guests to wrap one of their own books and bring it to party then give out to kids instead of a party bag containing sweets and plastic</li>
  <li>Gifting a book to a child, inscribe the jacket with a line on what’s he like at this age</li>
  <li>books starring tv character can make kids crave even more TV time</li>
</ul>

<p>older kids, and young adults</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Its recommendations of actual books were all US-centric - arguably not the fault of the author when the reader is from UK.</p>

<p>Towards the end, the format of the book made for a grueling read - for each age group, just a list of unconnected recommendations.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Book Notes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My sister and I had previously spoken about the fact I was reading this book.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://jonwhittlestone.github.io/notes/images/posts/wJ7pwwO.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://jonwhittlestone.github.io/notes/images/posts/wJ7pwwO.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Giving ourselves a reason - a letter to Alice</title><link href="https://jonwhittlestone.github.io/notes/memories/2021/11/14/memories-letter-to-alice.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Giving ourselves a reason - a letter to Alice" /><published>2021-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jonwhittlestone.github.io/notes/memories/2021/11/14/memories-letter-to-alice</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jonwhittlestone.github.io/notes/memories/2021/11/14/memories-letter-to-alice.html"><![CDATA[<style>

<p>
  Dorking, Surrey<br />
  14th November 2021
  </p>
<p>
  Dear Alice,
  </p>

<p>
  It's Daddy here.
  </p>
<p>
  Why am I writing you a letter, you're only 8 weeks old?<br /> Well, I just thought you'd want to know what's going on the with the park outside our house. I'll try not to go on too much.
  </p>
<p>
  As I write this, plans have been drawn up and sent to the council to get permission to build a bandstand. It'd be a part-time outdoor musical venue where people would come and listen to some live music on a Sunday afternoon.
  </p>
<p>
  "Is that such a good idea?" you might think.<br />
  Or, "Will my milk supply or napping cadence be affected?"<br />
  I'll come to the sleep point later so bear with your Dad!<br />
  I want to reassure you and paint a picture why the whole project is  good thing for us all now, and years to come.
  </p>
<p>
  It's all about giving us reasons.
  </p>
<p>
  The bandstand is giving us reason to come together and talk and listen and enjoy.<br />
  We're all finding it a bit hard at the moment Alice. It's not just that we've had a big health scare (more on that in a minute) but we've been forced inside and everyone's a bit nervous and suspicious of each other.
  </p>
<p> 
  We all do things less together now and that means less interacting with people different to us. Add in to the mix, the online echo chambers like Twitter and the usual suspects and this can lead to something called the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20211104160122/https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c171ac1710699e060ed3d94/t/5eebe2649fe4e4788eaf7d07/1592517269128/the-lesser-minds-problem.pdf" target="_blank">lesser minds problem.</a>.<br />
  The aim is giving people a reason to be together so you don't forget the person standing next to you is a competent, sentient, capable, thoughtful person just like us. (ok Alice, maybe not you just yet.).
  </p>
<p>
  The bandstand is giving us a reason to remember and be grateful.<br />
  The global Cornavirus pandemic is a catastrophe where many people and their loved ones lost their lives or endured painful struggle. In this country, our heroic NHS were the ones who tirelessly dealt with it and for that everyone is eternally grateful. Like the war memorial on South street [^1], the community bandstand would forever remind us.
  </p>
<p>
  The bandstand is giving us a reason to enjoy the arts<br />
  Not only does our local area have a deep musical heritage, I'm very proud to live in a country that has artistic and creative essence so woven into the seams. It would be a fantastic thing for our mental well-being and healing, to see live music regularly and support local musicians.
  </p>
<p>
  You might be thinking one of a few things.<br /><br />
  One might be, "This is all getting a bit preachy. Things aren't that bad. Is it time for my nap yet, or you could probably start folding the washing or sterilise my bottles"<br />
  I can also imagine you saying something like<br /><br />
  "In theory, the idea of this musical fandango sounds great. But in practice won't it be noisy and there's propensity for after-hours mischief from ne'er do-wells and vagrants. It's pretty close to our house after all"<br /><br />
  The response that comes back might be - thanks for reminding me about sticking to a firm napping regime, leading to good sleep hygiene in later life.<br />
  To your point about noise pollution - if it's recognised that it is a residential area, and performances should be seldom and rarely amplified - then I think the space can exist in harmony with its surroundings.<br /><br />
  And 'will it get abused' ?<br /><br />
  Ultimately, we have good kids and the space will be respected. Yes, intially there will be some excitement. We might get a few hicupps when boredom has taken hold like in the latter part of the summer holidays. I'm optimistic we can educate. The message is that it's a joint space for all and so we're all encouraged to look after what's ours.
  </p>
<p>
  That's the point really<br />
  The bandstand is giving us a reason to create a richer, more harmonious living environment to hand down to our young as we get old and wrinkly.<br />
  Thats all we're trying to do, even though it might not seem like it sometimes.
  </p>
<p>Right nap time for you little ally pally</p>
<p>I love you.<p>
  <p>Daddy x</p>

[^1]: Incidentally, on the site of that war memorial on South Street, there stood the previous Dorking bandstand up until the 1960's.

- In the book "Perceptrons", Marvin Minsky and Samuel Papert pointed out that only a single layer of artificial neurons couldn't learn simple mathematical functions, even though the latter part of the book addressed the limitation by highlighting the use of multiple layers.
- 30 years ago, researchers showed more layers were needed to get 'deep' learning and now neural nets are living up to their potential.

<hr />

<p>Tim Harford is a very engaging writer who appears part statistician, part economist, part historian.</p>

<p>The ultimate message from this `very entertaining author is <em>be curious</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule One: Notice your emotional response<br /><br /><em>Don’t accept or reject a claim just because of how it makes us feel</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule Two: Combine Statistical perspective with the ‘worm’s eye’ personal view</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule Three: Do we actually understand the labels?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule Four: Put claims into perspective by looking for comparisons and context.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule Five: Look behind the stats and where they came from.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule Six: What’s missing or not being represented.<br /><br /><em>Would our conclusions differ if they were included?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule Seven: Ask tough questions about algorithms?<br /><br /><em>Without intelligent openness, the big datasets that drive the algos cannot be trusted</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule Eight: Pay attention to the bedrock of official statistics.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule Nine: Look under the surface of any beautiful graph or chart.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule Ten: Keep an open mind.<br /><br /><em>Be like John Maynard Keynes who can change his mind and adapt with the times, not like Irving Fisher</em></p>

<p>I read this April 2021 and thoroughly enjoyed it. I write up these notes on a morning that J has been up through the night with a continuous cough <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.. I’ve been up since 4am. I hope this makes sense.</p>

<p>I decided to pick it up because I aim to have more tuned in emotional intelligence/empathy. I’d like to be able to deal with anger better and learn to regulate my emotions.</p>

<p>The book is not about weaning and potty taining but more about “relationships with our children, what gets in the way of a good connection and what can enhance it.”</p>

<p>Reflecting, after finishing the book, it may seem to contain a lot of touchy feely wisdom but it’s rooted in empirical pyschological study and research as well as containing case studies of Phillipa’s patients.</p>

<p>Phillipa Perry is a psychotherarpist for 20+ years. Her and her husband (Grayson, the artist) have a daughter.</p>

<p>I found useful strategy after useful strategy (parenting hacks) for how to create and maintain a happy and harmonious household, but I found it hard to believe that her own life bringing up a toddler was completely conflict free and hippy dippy lovely as her advice conveys! I find that lot of the strategy can go out of the window when you’ve had 5 hours of broken sleep!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I did ‘X’ growing up and it never did me any harm”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above statement is something we’ve all thought or said at some point. My hypothesis is that maybe the ‘harm’ is subtle and with help of the wisdom by the author, the habbit may be best avoided in your own parenting approach.</p>

<p>Covering the first part of the title, the author makes the point about your own upbringing. If the parent has been subjected to certain parenting misdemeanours/techniques, these could be have become internalised and this may be something you may not wish to repeat as a parent.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my key takeaways.</p>

<h1 id="my-takeaways">My takeaways</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Respect feelings
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“No one is wrong because their experience is different from what ours would be. Such differences need to be respected rather than causing you to get into arguments as to who is having the ‘right’ experience”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Judgement-Free and taking a feeling seriously without overreactiving and learning how to contain a chlid’s feelings.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“You can take a feeling seriously without overreacting and remain contained and optimistic. .. If a child knows they will be seen and soothed by not judged by you, they are more likely to tell you what is going on for them .. This is what a child needs: for a parent to be a container for their emotions .. and perhaps putting that into words for them. Finding acceptable ways for them to express their anger and not being punitive or overwhelmed by the anger”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Validating feelings is often more productive / gets you to your goal than denying/suppressing them.</p>

    <p>She makes the point, that telling a child off can make them more stubborn and validating a feeling can be like steering into a skid when you’re driving on ice.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It is rarely quicker to deny a child’s feelings. When we are in a hurry to get the school or nusery, and they don’t want to go. We could grab a toddler to put their coat on and then ask them to put it on by themselves. By which time they’re determined to not put it on. It would have been better to initially respect them and ackknowledge their feelings and observe, listen and repect their feelings. This may be by verbally acknowledging by saying ‘You hate being too hot, that’s why you don’t want to wear your coat. Okay, we’ll put it on once we’re outside and you start to feel cold’</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Constructive conflict.
    <ul>
      <li>Conflict, of all varieties, doesn’t make a great atmosphere in a home and puts children on alert and threatens their sense of security which leaves them less able to be open and curious about the world since all their energy are switched into a sort of emergency mode.</li>
      <li>‘I-statements’ rather than ‘You-statements’ are less accusatory
        <ul>

If you instead describe how what you hear or see makes you feel, then you are talking about yourself, which is far easier for the other person to hear.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Embrace conflict as its often the path to great deals and brings truth, creativity and resolution”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The line above was the real take home point for me. It’s, not to shy away from conflict. It can actually be fun and bring about real creativity and friendship.</p>

<p>A former FBI agent, Chris Voss explains his approaches to negotiation in high pressure real life hostage situations.</p>

<p>The second major point to resonate was his explanation of a bargaining approach. This could be described as a script or framework that you’d prepare to avoid the lacklustre dynamic where you and your negotiating counterpart would meet in the middle. (And no one is happy – as the book title suggests)</p>

<p>Chris Voss’ Ackerman system for buyers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have your desired target price in mind. A sensible and realistic amount could be 65% of asking price.</li>
  <li>Calculate 3 raises at decreasing increments of 85%, 95% and 100%</li>
  <li>Use lots of empathy and ways to say ‘No’ to get your counterpart to counter before you increase your offer</li>
  <li>When calculating the offer, use precise non-round numbers (e.g £37,983 instead of £38,000) to give your offer credibility and weight.</li>
</ol>

<p>The book teaches overcoming fear of conflict to get what you want out of life It makes the point that personal relationships can fail if participants don’t make their wishes and desires known as it can bring about compromise which can lead to bitterness and disillusionment</p>

<p>It’s all about rejecting the idea of chickening out of the wimp-win, and throwing out an extreme anchor. 
Do not be a slave to the amygalda - the part of the brain the processes fear.</p>

    <p>Negotiation is the heart of collaboration and makes conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all parties</p>

<h2 id="chapter-two---be-a-mirror-how-to-quickly-establish-rapport">Chapter Two - Be a mirror. How to quickly establish rapport</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for potential surprises. A great negotiator aims to use her skills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t commit to assumptions but make hypotheses and use negotiaton to test them rigorously</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who view negotiaton as a battle of arguments can become overwhelmed. Instead, think of it as a process of discovery and to uncover as much info as possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Focus on the other person and what they want to say. This helps quieten the voices in your head.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Slow.it. Down. Going too fast is a mistake all negotiators make Going too fast can make people feel they aren’t heard and you’ll lose rapport and trust.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h2 id="chapter-three--dont-feel-their-pain-label-it-how-to-create-trust-with-tactical-empathy">Chapter Three – Don’t feel their pain. Label It. How to create trust with tactical empathy.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Empathise: Imagine yourself in your counter part’s situation. By acknowledging their situation, you convey you are listening Once they know your are listening, they may tell you something you can use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons why a counterpart won’t make an agreement are more powerful than why would agree, so first work on removing barriers. Denying barriers negative influences gives them credence. Get them out in the open</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement. Let it sink in. They will fill the silence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amygalda is the part of the brain that generates fear. Address their fears a.s.a.p because the quicker you interrupt the amygalda by labelling their fears. the quicker you can generate feelings of safety + security and trust.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perform an accusation audit by listing the worst things they could say in order to prepare in advance to head off negative dynamics before they take root. When said aloud, the counterpart may even protest the opposite is true.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You’re dealing with a person that wants to be appreciated and understood so use labels to reinforce positive dynamics and perceptions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-four---beware-yes--master-no-how-to-generate-momentum-and-make-it-safe-to-reveal-the-real-stakes">Chapter Four - Beware ‘Yes’- Master ‘No’. How to generate momentum and make it safe to reveal the real stakes.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Break the habit of attempting to get people to say ‘Yes’ Not only does being pushed for ‘Yes’ make people defensive, it can make you blind to their reluctance / defensiveness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“No” is not a failure and something to be avoided. It often just means “wait” or “I’m not comfortable with that.” Learn to hear it calmly. It is not the end of a negotiation, but the beginning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Yes’ is the final aim of the negotiator, not the start Asking for a ‘Yes’ too early gets their guard up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Saying ‘No’ makes the speaker feel safe and in control. Trigger this feeling by asking what they don’t want or is not true. Eg. “Is now a bad time to talk?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes the only way to get your counterpart mislabelling their emotions or desires to force them into a “No”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>EG ‘it seems like you want this project to fail?’</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s about making them think it was their idea. Do not beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a potential business partner has given up, contact with a “no” oriented question that suggests you are ready to walk away. This works well 
“Have you given up on this project?”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-five---trigger-the-2-words-that-transform-any-negotiation-how-to-gain-the-permission-to-persuade">Chapter Five - Trigger the 2 words that transform any negotiation. How to gain “the permission to persuade”</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Creating unconditional positive regard opens the doorsnto changing thoughts and behaviours. Humans have an innate urge to socially constructive behaviour.
The more a person feels understood a positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely that urge for constructive behaviour will take hold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“That’s right” is better than “Yes”. strive for it. Reaching “That’s right”, creates breakthroughs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After active listening, use a summary to trigger a “that’s right”. The building blocks of a ‘that’s right’ are a paraphrase and a label. Identify, rearticulate and emotionally affirm, the world according to X</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-six-bend-their-reality-how-to-shape-what-is-fair">Chapter Six. Bend their reality. How to shape what is fair</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs. Don’t let yourself be fooled by the surface. once you know the Haitan kidnappers just want party money, you will be miles better prepared.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Splitting the difference is often wearing one brown and one black shoe, so don’t compromise. Meeting halfway often ends in bad deals for both sides.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approaching deadlines entice people to rush and to do things that aren’t beneficial to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The F. Word:” Fair” is an emotional team people use to put others on the defensive and gain concessions. If used by your counterpart, don’t get sucked in. Calmly ask for an explanation on how they think you are mistreating them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bend your counterpart’s reality by anchoring his starting point. Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be. When you get to numbers, make it extreme to make your real offer seem reasonable or set a range (with odd numbers) to seem less aggressive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People will take more risks to avoid a loss than realise again so make sure your counterpart sees “that there is something to lose by inaction</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-seven---create-the-illusion-of-control-calibrate-questions-to-transform-conflict-to-collaboration">Chapter Seven - Create the illusion of control. Calibrate questions to transform conflict to collaboration.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t try to strongarm your counterpart into admitting you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid questions that can be answered with ‘Yes’ or tiny peices of information. These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity You will be expected to give something back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t ask questions that start with ‘Why’ unless it’s for your counterpart to defend a stance that serves your goals. “Why’ is accusatory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart to solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend energy devising a solution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bite your tongue. When you’re attacked in a negotiation, pause and avoid angry reactions. Instead ask a calibrated question to lower their hostage mentality. It also gives the implication you want what the other guy wants but needs their intelligence to overcome the problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is always a team behind the table. If you’re not influencing the decision makers, you are vulnerable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-eight---guarantee-execution-how-to-spot-the-liars-and-ensure-follow-through">Chapter Eight - Guarantee Execution. How to spot the liars and ensure follow-through</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ask calibrated questions and ask them again and again. Asking ‘How’ keeps the counterpart engaged but off-balance. Answering them will give them the illusion of control but force them to think about your situation when making their demands.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use ‘How’ questions to subtly say ‘No’ - this pushes your counterpart to think of other solutions that would serve your agenda Very often it will get them to bid against themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t just pay attention to those you’re interacting with directly, find out the motivations of those behind the table. You can do this by asking how a deal will affect everyone and how on-board they are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the 7-38-55 rule by paying attention to words, tone of voice, body language. Incongruence between words and non-verbal indicators will show your counterpart is uncomfortable with a deal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the ‘Yes’ real or counterfeit? Use the rule of three, use labels, summaries and calibrated questions to have your counterpart reaffirm their agreement at least 3 times. It’s hard to fake conviction repeatedly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person’s use of pronouns offers deep insight into their relative authority. Hearing a lot of ‘I’ ‘Me’ and ‘My’ the authority may lie elsewhere Picking up a lot of ‘We’, ‘they ‘and ‘Them’- this is probably a savvy decision maker keeping options open.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use your own name to make yourself a real person to the other side. Humour and Humanity are the best way to remove roadblocks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-nine---bargain-hard-how-to-get-your-price">Chapter Nine - Bargain Hard. How to get your price</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Identify your counterpart’s negotiating style. You can approach accordingly once you know if they are, assertive, analyst, accomodator</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare, prepare, prepare. Design an ambitious but legitimate goal and then game out the labels, calibrated questions, and responses so you don’t have to wing it at the bargaining table</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get ready to take a punch. Kick-ass negotiators usually lead with an extreme anchor to knock you off your game. Prepare your dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into the compromise trap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set boundaries and learn to take a punch or punch back without anger. The person opposite isn’t the problem, the situation is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have the counterpart believe they are squeezing you for all you’re worth prepare on ackerman plan before you start with decreasing rates of 65%,85%, 95% and 100% of target price using calibrated questions to avoid saying ‘no’  to compel them to revise their offer</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-ten-find-the-black-swan-how-to-make-breakthroughs-by-finding-the-unknown-unknowns">Chapter Ten. Find the black swan. How to make breakthroughs by finding the unknown unknowns</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Let what you know, your known knowns, guide you but not blind you.  Every situation is different so be flexible and adaptable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Black swans are leverage multipliers.</p>

    <p>The three types of leverage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Positive: Ability to give someone what they want</li>
      <li>Negative: Ability to hurt someone</li>
      <li>Normative: Using your counterpart’s norms to bring them round</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work to understand the other side’s religion. Digging into worldviews, life, emotions is where black swans lie.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review everything you hear from the counterpart. Use backup listeners, compare notes with team members</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exploit the similarity principle. People are more likely to concede with some one they share a cultural similarity with so find out what makes them tick. and show them common ground</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When someone’s choice seems they are crazy, they probably aren’t. Search for hidden desires, bad information, constraints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Face to face discussions are most valuable to get the non-verbal cues and unguarded moments.</p>
  </li>

<p>I’ve taken a major step and started using a phone without a web browser and apps.</p>

<p>Some say, a <em>rash</em> step.</p>

<p>Some say, an <em>isolating</em> step.</p>

<p>I say, it’s an attempt to try and be in the moment a bit more. Especially as lockdown restrictions are ending and everyone will finally be allowed outside. All that refound excitement in the world, why do I need to check social feeds on a smartphone??</p>

<p>This week I started using <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/light-phone-one-week">Light Phone II</a> as an experiment. It’s an E Ink phone with limited features. 
However, in case you need to use the internet connection with another device, it does have a 4G modem with the ability to tether the connection (It’s an Android OS under the covers)</p>

<p>Perhaps I will feel fairly isolated at first but may mean I’m a better parent, husband and focused <a href="http://howapped.com">consultant</a>!</p>
